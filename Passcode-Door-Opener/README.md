# Arduino Door Unlock Device to Open Dorm Door with Passcode

My first semester at MIT, my roommate liked to keep the door locked, but I absoluetly refused to carry a key around. So we built this passcode gaurded door opener. It worked quite well! Do to how we coded the password (by waving your hand in front of the eyepiece), our friends couldn't even get past it without explicit instruction on how to open it. </br>
