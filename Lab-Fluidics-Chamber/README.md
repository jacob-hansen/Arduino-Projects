# Fluidics Chamber Robot for Fixing Cells at High Pressure
</br>
Developed for HB Biotech LLC in Salt Lake City, we aimed to fix cells at up to 2000psi in a controlled environment. Studies revolved around validating a general mechanism for anesthesia. Back in 1971, it was shown that pressure can reverse the effects of anesthesia. So much so, one could wake up anesthetized mice and newts. See [1971 Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/231368a0). Recent studies at the Scripps Research Institute have proposed a [mechanism for general anesthesia](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004259117). We aimed to further validate this mechanism by explaining its role in the the pressure reversibility of anesthesia. I designed the mechanics of the pressure system to get to such a high pressure. I also various meachanisms for dumping formaldehyde on the cells to fix them. One being a quick dumping solution, another being a more complicated fluidics robot. </br>
