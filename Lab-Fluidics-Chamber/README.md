# Fluidics Chamber Robot for Fixing Cells at High Pressure
</br>
Developed for HB Biotech LLC in Salt Lake City, we aimed to fix cells at up to 2000psi in a controlled environment. Studies revolved around validating a general mechanism for anesthesia. Back in 1971, it was shown that pressure can reverse the effects of anesthesia. So much so, one could wake up anesthetized mice and newts. See https://www.nature.com/articles/231368a0. Recent studies at the Scripps Research Institute have proposed a mechanism for general anesthesia (See https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004259117). We aimed to further validate this mechanism by explaining its role in the the pressure reversibility of anesthesia. I designed the mechanics of the pressure system to get to such a high pressure. I also various meachanisms for dumping formaldehyde on the cells to fix them. One being a quick dumping solution, another being a more complicated fluidics robot (as featured in the video on file). </br>
Project tasks included CAD modeling, arduino electrical circuit design and implementation, and arduino coding in C++.

Later, I was contracted again to build a fly monitor system also for the high pressure chamber. Normal cameras have difficulty focusing at extremely high pressure. Nor do most autofocus cameras have the range needed to focus at high pressure. I built a system for remote focus with a manual focus camera and dimable lights. Additionally, the system monitors and controls temperature, humidity, and fly fan speed. </br></br>
